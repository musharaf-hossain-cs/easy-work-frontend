# EasyWork - A Project Management Tool
## Short Description
This project aims to create a comprehensive platform for managing projects, tasks, and subtasks, milestones, budget estimation and cost management. The system will streamline the project management process by providing an all-in-one solution that can be accessed from any device with internet access.

## Features

* Project Management: The system will allow users to create and manage multiple projects and keep track of their progress.

* Task Management: Users will be able to create and assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, and track progress.

* Subtask Management: The system will support the creation of subtasks to break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable components.

* Milestone Tracking: Users will be able to set milestones for their projects and track their progress towards meeting those milestones.

* Budget Estimation: The system will provide tools for estimating project budgets and tracking actual costs.

* Cost Management: The system will provide users with a comprehensive view of project costs and allow them to manage those costs effectively.

* Collaboration: The platform will provide collaboration features such as task assignment, comments, and file sharing to facilitate communication and collaboration among team members.

Overall, the Project Management System will be an invaluable tool for project managers and teams, allowing them to stay organized, on-track and within budget.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
